  *NY Times*'s article discusses possibilities to explain and foreshadow Meta's current and future troubles regarding the Metaverse, Facebook, and Instagram after their stock "plunged by more than 230 billion dollars". The current issues Meta faces includes hitting their user growth ceiling, changes in the data privacy from companies like Apple, and how new apps such as TikTok and Reels have affected their ways of making money off of their users. To begin with, Apple introduced an __App Tracking Transparency__ update to its operating system, "giving users the choice to ... let apps like Facebook monitor their online activities", disallowing them useful marketing data to make money off of ads, their most successful platform. Furthermore, apps such as Tiktok "present [Facebook with] a conundrum" due to the fact that to compete with Tiktok they have to focus on Reels, however while they have been very successful for bringing viewership to Instagram, they make the least amount of money per ad as users "tend to skip right past them". These newfound opponents of ad-space, users, and data privacy, along with Facebook's questionable funding of the Metaverse, have placed a dark cloud over Meta, scaring potential investors away leading to their stock plummet.
