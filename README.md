This essay examines the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on global emotions via social media.MIT researchers look at millions of social media posts from around the world. After the pandemic takes hold in early 2020, there will be a significant drop in favorable public sentiment. Following that, there was a gradual, halting return to pre-pandemic state. The findings were published today in the journal Nature Human Behaviour. Australia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Colombia experienced the greatest declines in sentiment. Bahrain, Botswana, Greece, Oman, and Tunisia were the countries least hit by the pandemic. Lockdown policies did not appear to have a significant impact on popular sentiment. Some countries required up to 29 days to recover half of the dip in public opinion that occurred during a lockdown. Researchers discovered that 18% of countries did not recover to their pre-lockdown, pre-surgical attitude levels.
