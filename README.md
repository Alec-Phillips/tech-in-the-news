* [Sony is buying Bungie, the developer of Destiny and original creator of Halo](https://www.theverge.com/22910846/sony-bungie-acquisition-playstation-destiny-halo)

  This article is about the recent acquisition of games developer Bungie by Sony Interactive Entertainment for 3.6 billion dollars. This seems problematic for the playerbase of Bungie's current game "Destiny 2" because Sony owning Bungie may make Destiny 2 a PlayStation exclusive game. However, Bungie says that they have an agreement to remain independent and that the game will remain multi-platform and crossplay and will not feature PlayStation exclusive content, something that has existed in Destiny 2 before. This is similar to Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, a sign of console companies buying developers around them to support their respective platforms.

* [Why SNK shifted to Unreal Engine for its latest fighting games](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/developer-interviews/why-snk-shifted-to-unreal-engine-for-its-latest-fighting-games)

  SNK decided to use the unreal engine for their latest game, The King of Fighters XV, which helped the development and quality of the final product. The unreal engine provided benefits to development such as easier time porting and enhanced shader capabilities. SNK used unreal engine for their previous title Samurai Shodown, which was a success and they are developing a future game with unreal engine. The King of Fighters XIV did not use unreal engine, but SNK was experimenting with unreal engine during that game's development, so the transition was easy.

* [Tesla wants its cars to be Steam compatible](https://www.pcgamer.com/tesla-wants-its-cars-to-be-steam-compatible/)

  In a tweet, Elon Musk reveals that Tesla is working towards making their cars Steam compatible. New Tesla models currently have an AMD GPU that is able to run demanding games on the dashboard. The dashboard makes use of a Linux operating system, which Steam currently is optimizing for things like the Steam Deck. The only confirmation of this happening is Elon Musk’s tweet. Also Tesla is currently being investigated by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for some games being playable while driving, which has been disabled since last December.

* [Bungie slams YouTube for DMCA 'security loophole' and lousy customer service](https://www.pcgamer.com/bungie-slams-youtube-for-dmca-security-loophole-and-lousy-customer-service/)

  A few weeks ago Bungie, the developer of Destiny 2, saw content on YouTube related to Destiny receiving DMCA takedowns from a bad actor abusing the copyright system on YouTube. Bungie is criticizing YouTube for giving an unauthorized individual access to copyright protections and is taking legal action against the bad actors. YouTube likes to take a “hands off” approach to DMCA claims in favor for more automation due to the number of videos posted in the platform everyday. However, this approach allowed a malicious third party to abuse the system, harming the reneve of legitimate content creators and even striking down videos on Bungie’s own channel. This is a good example of the current copyright issues that come with internet content. Companies have every right to protect their properties, however the systems in place are easily abused and can harm people and now even the legitimate rights holders of intellectual property.
  
* [Valve says sanctions are blocking payments to Steam game devs in Ukraine, Russia](https://www-polygon-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.polygon.com/platform/amp/23003359/valve-steam-ukraine-russia-developers-bank-regulations-payment?amp_gsa=1&amp_js_v=a9&usqp=mq331AQIKAGwASCAAgM%3D#amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&aoh=16487097701935&csi=1&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F23003359%2Fvalve-steam-ukraine-russia-developers-bank-regulations-payment)

  Due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, game developers in these regions are unable to receive income from Steam sales because the bank that delivers funds is blocked by economic sanctions. These developers have asked Valve when they can find a way to get their money but Valve does not know when they will be able to deliver the funds. This is one of many economic hardships brought about by the war in Ukraine. These developers depend on that income for their livelihood, so they must be struggling to make ends meet. It is reassuring that a solution may present itself to give the developers their money, but it is far away and is guaranteed.
  
* [Quantum computers are many years away from cracking crypto: MIT Tech Review](https://cointelegraph.com/news/quantum-computers-are-years-away-from-cracking-crypto-mit-tech-review)

  Current crypto currencies and blockchain technology is not possible to hack with current computing power; however, when quantum computers are developed this could be a problem. The processing power of a quantum computer would invalidate all modern cryptography, thus making the large quantity of money on the blockchain unsafe when that day comes. Many scientists are working on quantum-proof cryptography that would allow the blockchain to not be hacked wide open. Quantum computing would be a massive technological achievement that could improve our society, but it can also cause problems. A great leap in technology is always inevitable, so we must prepare for the day quantum computing is a reality or any other significant technological leap is achieved for the possible negative consequences it could have on society.
