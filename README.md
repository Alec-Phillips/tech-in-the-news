* [Sony is buying Bungie, the developer of Destiny and original creator of Halo](https://www.theverge.com/22910846/sony-bungie-acquisition-playstation-destiny-halo)

  This article is about the recent aquisition of games developer Bungie by Sony Interactive Entertainment for 3.6 billon dollars. This seems problematic for the playerbase of Bungies current game "Destiny 2" because Sony owning Bungie may make Destiny 2 a PlayStation exclusive game. However, Bungie says that they have an agreement to remain independant and that the game will remain multi-platform and crossplay and will not feature PlayStation exlusive content, something that has existed in Destiny 2 before. This is similar to Microsoft's aqusition of Activision Blizzard, a sign of console companies buying developers around them to support their respective platforms.
