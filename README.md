  The Public Health Agency of Canada, or PHAC, has recently come under fire after it was revealed the government agency had been buying cellphone data from telecom companies in order to track its citizens. The *Global News* article elaborates that the Canadian cellphone provider, Telus, provided the PHAC location and movement data in order to give government officials a greater understanding of their COVID-19 policy. The PHAC has also gone on to state that it is planning to utilize the information it purchased from Telus outside of solely COVID-19 research. Although it should be noted that the data itself was scrubbed in order to prevent the identification of any specific individuals, many are stillquestioning if current data and privacy laws are strong enough and if there needs to be a better policy precedent for government bodies to buy or utilize data from private entities.
