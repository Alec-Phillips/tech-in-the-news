* [After face-recognition backlash, ID.me says government agencies will get more verification options](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/08/tech/idme-facial-recognition-bypass/index.html)

The IRS stopped their plan of letting users get verified by facial-recognition
through ID.me because of the frustration of being verified through ID.me software.
The facial-recognition software of video selfies with a photo ID would fail more often than succeed and users would now
be able to verify their identity by talking to a real person instead.
There was pushback for the long waits it took for the facial-recognition technology to work and
how privacy advocates were against the use of facial-recognition
because of how biometric data is kept in ID.me's database.
Some federal agencies are questioning if their websites will continue to 
use ID.me for security reasons in the future because of privacy concerns.
