* [Sunroom is an alternative creator platform empowering women to cash in](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/02/sunroom-creator-platform-app-women/)

  This TechCrunch article is about Sunroom, a new social media app aiming to address the
  heavy content moderation many women and non-binary content creators face on popular social
  media apps, such as Instagram by building a more open-minded platform where creators,
  only women and non-binary creators as of now, can profit off their work. As the article
  notes, Sunroom “isn’t trying to make another OnlyFans”. Instead, they hope to make a social
  media platform with limited censorship, where women and non-binary people can break down
  stigmas to profit off their creative work. The app has only 100 content creators as of its
  launch, and hopes to scale slowly to keep hands-on moderation and censorship low.


* [Apple fined again over Dutch dating app payments order](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/07/apple-third-dutch-antitrust-fine/)

   This TechCrunch article is about Apple's "antitrust standoff in the Netherlands". Apple has 
   an outstanding 15M euros from this impasse over Apple's disallowing local dating apps to use 
   third party payment providers, instead requiring such apps to use Apple's own payment 
   infrastructure which Apple gets commissions from. Apple has been fighting the order, but just 
   last month agreed to let apps use other payment providers. However, the Dutch government is 
   still fined Apple over frustration with their general failure to comply.
