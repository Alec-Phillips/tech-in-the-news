* [What Is 5G? An Electrical Engineer Explains the Technology](https://scitechdaily.com/what-is-5g-an-electrical-engineer-explains-the-technology/)

The 5th generation of cellular networks technology is 5G and offers 10 times more bandwidth than 4G.
The speeds of 5G can deliver from 50 megabits up to 1 GB per 
second which can download large files and stream movies very fast and easily. 
There are different band frequencies 5G can use, being that lower-frequency waves
can extend further out, but have slower speeds and higher-frequency waves 
have the fastest speeds, but do not travel as far and cost more money which is why it is used in high concentration areas
like stadiums and airports. Even though 5G speeds can be extremely fast, 
the more people in the area that are using 5G can carry more traffic for the bandwidth
and cause slower connection speeds. Even though there are minor problems with 5G,
it is still improving and has to potential to be the best cellular network technology yet.
