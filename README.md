* [Sony is buying Bungie, the developer of Destiny and original creator of Halo](https://www.theverge.com/22910846/sony-bungie-acquisition-playstation-destiny-halo)

  This article is about the recent acquisition of games developer Bungie by Sony Interactive Entertainment for 3.6 billion dollars. This seems problematic for the playerbase of Bungie's current game "Destiny 2" because Sony owning Bungie may make Destiny 2 a PlayStation exclusive game. However, Bungie says that they have an agreement to remain independent and that the game will remain multi-platform and crossplay and will not feature PlayStation exclusive content, something that has existed in Destiny 2 before. This is similar to Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, a sign of console companies buying developers around them to support their respective platforms.

* [Why SNK shifted to Unreal Engine for its latest fighting games](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/developer-interviews/why-snk-shifted-to-unreal-engine-for-its-latest-fighting-games)

  SNK decided to use the unreal engine for their latest game, The King of Fighters XV, which helped the development and quality of the final product. The unreal engine provided benefits to development such as easier time porting and enhanced shader capabilities. SNK used unreal engine for their previous title Samurai Shodown, which was a success and they are developing a future game with unreal engine. The King of Fighters XIV did not use unreal engine, but SNK was experimenting with unreal engine during that game's development, so the transition was easy.

* [Tesla wants its cars to be Steam compatible](https://www.pcgamer.com/tesla-wants-its-cars-to-be-steam-compatible/)

  In a tweet, Elon Musk reveals that Tesla is working towards making their cars Steam compatible. New Tesla models currently have an AMD GPU that is able to run demanding games on the dashboard. The dashboard makes use of a Linux operating system, which Steam currently is optimizing for things like the Steam Deck. The only confirmation of this happening is Elon Muskâ€™s tweet. Also Tesla is currently being investigated by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for some games being playable while driving, which has been disabled since last December.
