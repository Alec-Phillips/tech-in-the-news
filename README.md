* [Engineers develop a 'magnetic tentacle robot' to pass into the narrow tubes of the lung](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/03/220321205411.htm)

In the lungs, there are many small bronchial tubes that can be hard to reach. Engineers have made a prototype of a robot that can reach these tubes and take tissue samples or deliver cancer therapy. Researchers at the University of Leeds have created a magnetic tentacle robot. It could be used to help with endoscopic and catheter operations, which involve inserting a small tube into the body. This week, researchers published their findings in the journal Soft Robotics. A robot that can navigate the bronchial tree has been developed by researchers at the University of Leeds. Magnetic tentacle robots are tiny, flexible, and controlled. Outside of the patient, autonomous robotic arms would guide the gadget into position.This could be an evolutionary change for the medical industry. If we put this technology in the simplest way, it means that this technology could potentianlly save more people's lives and reduce their pain. In the long term impact, this magnetic tentacle robot has a greater potentinal in treating other diseases such a blood vessels or urine track disease. in conclusion, the invetion of  magnetic tentacle robot is a potential solution for many difficult medical operation and could impact many people and thier families.
