This essay examines the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on global emotions via social media.MIT researchers look at millions of social media posts from around the world. After the pandemic takes hold in early 2020, there will be a significant drop in favorable public sentiment. Following that, there was a gradual, halting return to pre-pandemic state. The findings were published today in the journal Nature Human Behaviour. Australia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Colombia experienced the greatest declines in sentiment. Bahrain, Botswana, Greece, Oman, and Tunisia were the countries least hit by the pandemic. Lockdown policies did not appear to have a significant impact on popular sentiment. Some countries required up to 29 days to recover half of the dip in public opinion that occurred during a lockdown. Researchers discovered that 18% of countries did not recover to their pre-lockdown, pre-surgical attitude levels. In my opinion, this article shows how social media influence the society during the pendamic, while many people is required to quareteen themselves if they get caught by covid, the lost of freedom enforeces a trumendous amount of mental stress on these people. Social media become one of the major technology for these people to entertain themselves during those times. however, there are downsides to it, the social media became one of the major communication tool around the world, meaning people could potentinally receive a large amount of negative information about the pandemic , causing them additional stress.
