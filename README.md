  Through Tipping Point, NASA seeks to support space technologies that can foster
  the growth of commercial space capabilities and benefit future agency missions. 
  “Public-private partnerships established through these opportunities will combine 
  agency resources with industry contributions, a benefit that will unlock new ideas to 
  advance how we live and work in space while providing greater value to the American 
  people.” These opportunities focus on technology development for space 
  infrastructure and capabilities for the Moon and near-Earth space. "Forging strong 
  partnerships with the commercial space economy is critical for driving our nation’s 
  space exploration further and faster," said Jim Reuter, associate administrator for the 
  Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) at NASA’s Headquarters in Washington, 
  which manages the new opportunities. More than half a billion dollars have been awarded to 50
  projects since NASA announced the first Tipping Point opportunity in 2015. Space 
  technologies advanced through this funding are now part of current and future mission plans.
