  In thie article, the author claims that more criminals chooses to use crypto currency to laundering money due to low transaction fees with while decentralisation offers criminals greater anonymity and security protection from the authorities. Chainalysis says that after tracking cryto currency wallets controleed by criminals they found that they have laundered over $8.6 billions of cryptocurrency in 2021, "up by 30%" since 2020.  According to the research, cryptocurrency laundering accounts for 17% of all monies sent from unlawful wallets, up from 2% in 2016. Money from offline crime, such as drug trafficking funds converted to cryptocurrencies to be laundered, is not covered, and the report warns that this could be a growing area. The paper claims that this is low in comparison to more traditional ways of money laundering, "suggesting that Bitcoin-based laundering could become increasingly attractive to traditional criminals."
