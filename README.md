* [Texas Sues Meta Over Facebook’s Facial-Recognition Practices](https://www.wsj.com/articles/texas-sues-meta-over-facebooks-facial-recognition-practices-11644854794)

The Texas attorney general has now filed a suit against Meta Platforms alleging that Facebook violated privacy law within the state for the way it handled biometrics. The biometrics and facial recognition cited in the lawsuit was scrapped back in November of 2021, however, Texas AG Ken Paxton stated that for over a decade the existence of facial geometric data within Facebook's platform has resulted in the violation of Texas law. Within the lawsuit Mr. Paxton stated that "Facebook has been secretly harvesting Texans' personal information... for its own corporate profit" and that to do so without informed consent is illegal. Within the Texas law a single privacy infraction draws a $25,000 fine, over the course of the decade Facebook has broken that law millions of times, meaning Texas officials are asking for hundreds of billions of dollars in restitution. It should also be noted that this lawsuit has come about after Facebook settled with the state of Illinois for their class-action lawsuit regarding similar grievances with Facebook's facial recognition and data collection practices.

The Public Health Agency of Canada, or PHAC, has recently come under fire after it was revealed the government agency had been buying cellphone data from telecom companies in order to track its citizens. The *Global News* article elaborates that the Canadian cellphone provider, Telus, provided the PHAC location and movement data in order to give government officials a greater understanding of their COVID-19 policy. The PHAC has also gone on to state that it is planning to utilize the information it purchased from Telus outside of solely COVID-19 research. Although it should be noted that the data itself was scrubbed in order to prevent the identification of any specific individuals, many are stillquestioning if current data and privacy laws are strong enough and if there needs to be a better policy precedent for government bodies to buy or utilize data from private entities.
