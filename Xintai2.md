* [Silicon Valley is no longer the edgy tech frontier as workers flee Google and Amazon for crypto and Web3 startups, recruiters say]( https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-workers-leaving-for-crypto-web3-startups-silicon-valley-recruiters-2022-2)

  Katie Canales’ Business Insider article details how recently there has been 
  a trend of high-profile executives and developers leaving established firms 
  to find jobs in crypto and other decentralized tech ventures. A leading 
  example of this is how the former CMO of Meta’s digital wallet project, 
  Novi, has left the company to pursue a position at the blockchain-focused 
  payments company Circle. This effect is similar to that of the wave of job 
  switching in the early 2010s that saw the arrival of companies such as Uber 
  and Lyft. Whether or not this is just a trend in Silicon Valley or a lasting 
  effect, only the future will know what is in store for the workers who leave
  for crypto and Web3 startups.
